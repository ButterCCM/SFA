Street Fighter Alpha
--------------------

* Does not seem to work well in Safari on Windows (probably the same on Mac) *

* Currently only Ken and Ryu are playable *

Jun-21-2012: Expect a huge update within the next few days. All animation will use css sprites, instead of individual images. This will allow for much faster load times and other performance enchancements.
